//strings are basically improvised version of arrays.
// they are initialised in two ways and there initialization determine the place where it would be storing the string .


//they are initialized in two ways.

//String<String name> = "< enter string here >";
//this will store data or string in the STRING POOL AREA .... it is called Initialized by literals.

//String <String name>= new String("<enter string here>");
//this will store data in heap area.






////////////////Declaring a string by string literal is good as it optimizes the memory required by our programe...
